52.3.2:
* Fixed retrievulator recipe.

52.3.1:
* Reversed the order the ACT2 searches for items.

52.3.0:
* Adjusted recipes. The ACT2's RP2-based recipes are significantly cheaper, and its
  BC-based recipes are slightly more expensive.
* Fixed the Liquid Disposer being cheaper than intended - a simple copy-paste error.
* Added Online Player Detector, for servers which require you to turn your machines off when you're offline.
* Fixed BHC animation - turns out I was relying on a bug in my graphics driver, so have a distorted end portal effect instead.
* Fixed problems with the BHC's GUI.

52.2.2:
* Fixed item spawning/duping bug, server owners should update immediately!

52.2.1:
* Fixed existing ACT2s, but not new ones, flashing golden hoes in all slots - a leftover debugging "feature". 

52.2.0:
* Added: Any wrench that implements BC's IToolWrench counts as a wrench. This includes crescent hammers and omniwrenches.
* Added: Forge and IC2 ore-dictionary recipe support to the ACT2. Click the new "OD" button after entering a recipe to enable this.
  For example, if you set a 3x3 grid of IC2 copper then click the button, the ACT2 will accept any type of copper to make
  copper blocks. Editing the recipe after pressing the button will undo the effect.
* Added: NEI integration. Open an ACT2 GUI, then click the ? in an NEI recipe, to import the recipe. 
* Added: Click the new "C" button in an ACT2 to clear the recipe.

52.1.3:
* Fixed Minium Stones, RP2 handsaws, etc not being destroyed when used up in the ACT2.

52.1.1:
* Removed console spam listing RedPower items.

52.1.0:
* Added liquid duplicator and liquid disposer.

52.0.8:

52.0.7:
* Removed retrievulator debug spam.

52.0.6:
* Fixed RedPower compatibility for crafting recipes and retrievulators.

52.0.5:

51.0.5:
* Improved auto-assigning.

51.0.4:
* ACT2's will not crash if a mod tries to put items in an unknown side. Mods that do this will access the entire input buffer, but you
  should tell them to fix themselves. It will also print a warning to the console the first time it happens.

51.0.3:
* Gave fake players a username of [TubeStuff]

51.0.2:
* Fixed buffer output to BuildCraft.
* Removed the peripheral functions of the buffer. Nobody uses it and turtles can do everything it can do, except for ID detection (without an addon)

51.0.0:
* Fixed retriever jammer background (it's now transparent)
* Allowed retrievulators to be rotated with any "wrench".
* Allowed ACT2's to be rotated with any "wrench".
* The following items count as wrenches: RP2 screwdriver, RP2 sonic screwdriver, BC wrench, IC wrench, stone hoe.
* Capitalized "block" in names.
* Gave silver, tin, copper and brass blocks ore dictionary recipes.
* Added block breaker.
* Made blocks non-opaque, necessary for the block breaker. They still count as solid on all sides.
* Updated to 1.4.5.
* Ended support for 1.2.5, 1.3.2 and 1.4.2.

50.1.4:
* Fixed recipes being invisible (but still working) in SMP, unless you played SSP first.

50.1.3:
* Added 1/64 button to ACT2.

50.1.2:
* Added charcoal blocks (requested by alfw)
* Added config option for slow (sand-like) falling of redstone and nikolite blocks. (1.4.2 only)
  Disabled by default because the sand dupe bug affects this. They have odd textures while falling (vanilla/Forge bug)
  With this disabled they just teleport to the ground, like before.

50.1.1:
* Fixed the buffer's interaction with Buildcraft in 1.4.2.

50.1.0:
* Updated to 1.4.2.

50.0.2:
* Fixed BuildCraft detection in 1.3.

50.0.1:
* Fixed storage blocks not appearing in NEI and creative (except for silver)

50.0.0pr2:
* Fixed crash on startup on non-LAN servers.

50.0.0pr1:
* Updated to 1.3.2. A LOT of internal changes for 1.2.5 and 1.3.2 compatibility.
  Fortunately, you don't need to worry about those.
* Fixed crash when you had redpower.cfg but didn't actually have RedPower.

49.3.0:
* If any exception is thrown while trying to add the retriever jammer to the
  IC2 recycler blacklist, it will be ignored. (Possibly caused by having the IC2 API
  but not IC2 itself)
* Retrievulators now always stop emitting a redstone signal when there are enough items
  in the target inventory.
* All blocks are now non-solid and will not conduct redstone. Retrievulators can be placed
  adjacent to each other without causing problems.
* Retriever jammers on the ground will disappear if you walk over them instead of being picked up.
* Retrievulators will slow down after some time without any items passing through them.
* Retrievulators can be rotated with screwdrivers (including sonic screwdrivers)
* Added storage blocks
* Added config option to disable retrievulators.

49.2.0:
* Started this changelog
* Fixed BHC shift-clicking
* Retrievulator now uses fake slots similar to the Logistics Pipe ones in the T area.
  Existing items in this area will become fake items and you will not be able to get
  them back!
  Right click to add, left click to subtract items. Shift to go faster. If the slot
  is empty, click on it with any stack to copy that stack.

49.1.3:
* Made BHC config option available on servers, so you don't have to spawn it.
* Fixed BHC chunk corruption
* Fixed retrievulator orientation in SMP
